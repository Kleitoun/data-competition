# Data Competition
A repository containing the codes I worked on for the data competition done as part of a course during my Masters degree. This course was Fundamentals of Machine Learning - IFT6758 at Université de Montréal. The data competition consisted of two parts: 
- In the first one, a logistic regression was used and then we used an XGBoost in order to classify extreme weather events; 
- In the second one, an XGBoost model was built towards classifying land as either crop or non-crop.
